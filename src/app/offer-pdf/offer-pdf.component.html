With or without notice to me, ICICI Bank may alter, compromise, accelerate, extend or change the time or manner for the payment by the Borrower of any indebtedness hereby guaranteed, increase or reduce the rate of interest thereon, release or reduce the rate of interest thereon, and release or add one or more guarantors.

                        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">I hereby irrevocably and unconditionally covenant and agree that I am liable for the Guaranteed Obligations as a primary obligor. In the event of ICICI Bank making a demand upon me under this Personal Guarantee, or demand upon other owners of the Borrower under their personal guarantees, each owner shall be held and bound to ICICI Bank directly as principal debtor in respect of the payment of the amounts guaranteed and liability of each owner shall be joint and several.</p>
                        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">This Personal Guarantee is an irrevocable, absolute, continuing guarantee of payment and performance and as such, ICICI Bank shall not be obliged to take any action or exhaust any rights or remedies it may have against the Borrower, any other guarantor, any other person or firm or corporation, before requiring or being entitled to payment from me of all Guaranteed Obligations.</p> 
                        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">This Personal Guarantee may not be revoked by me and shall continue to be effective with respect to any Guaranteed Obligations arising or created after any attempted revocation by me.  The fact that at any time or from time to time the Guaranteed Obligations may be increased or reduced, shall not release or discharge my obligation to ICICI Bank with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations.</p>
                        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">If all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations shall not be punctually paid when due, whether at demand, maturity, acceleration or otherwise, I shall, immediately upon demand by ICICI Bank and without presentment, protest, notice of protest, notice of non-payment, notice of intention to accelerate the maturity, notice of acceleration of the maturity or any other notice whatsoever, pay the amount due under the Guaranteed Obligations to ICICI Bank in accordance with the Line of Credit Documents. Such demand(s) may be made at any time, coincidently with or after the time for payment of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations and may be made from time to time with respect to the same or different items of Guaranteed Obligations. Such demand shall be deemed made, given and received in accordance with the notice provisions hereof.</p>

        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">I will apply to ICICI Bank in ICICI Bank’s prescribed form for using ICICI Bank’s banking services. ICICI Bank will be entitled at its sole discretion to accept or reject such applications as I may submit.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">This Agreement, the Cardholder Agreement, the Direct Banking Terms, ICICI Bank’s Client Privacy Policy, ICICI Bank’s Website Terms of Use, ICICI Bank’s RSP Terms and Conditions, and any other agreement or terms and conditions as may be stipulated by ICICI Bank from time to time (the "Account Documents") form the contract between me and ICICI Bank for using ICICI Bank’s banking services and will apply to all my Accounts and all my transactions and other activities in connection with the banking services of ICICI Bank. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, all terms and conditions stipulated by ICICI Bank pertaining to the Account will continue to be applicable to me. The terms of this Agreement will be in addition to and not in derogation of the terms and conditions relating to my Account.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">If I make use of any of the banking services provided by ICICI Bank from time to time, whether Branch Banking or Direct Banking, it will mean that I have received and read the Account Documents applicable to my Account. It will also mean that I have understood and agreed with ICICI Bank to everything written here and in the Account Documents applicable to my Account, and I understand that the Account Documents are applicable to all Accounts that I may have with ICICI Bank from time to time. Unless ICICI Bank otherwise agrees, I must make all payments under this Agreement in money which is legal tender at the time of payment.</p>

        <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Use</h6>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">I may use a Personal Account for my personal banking needs. Unless ICICI Bank has agreed to it first, I must not use an Account for the purpose of carrying on business or an enterprise. For my business banking needs I may use a Business Account. I will not use a newly opened Account until ICICI Bank permits me to do so.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Service Charges</h6>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">I must pay all service charges that apply to an Account, as set out in the Disclosure Statement. ICICI Bank will be entitled to charge these to my Account at the time I incur the same or in case these are not paid when due.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Term Deposits</h6>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">I understand that ICICI Bank guarantees repayment at maturity of the principal sum and the interest earned on my term deposit with ICICI Bank (a "Term Deposit"). Unless otherwise instructed by me, at maturity the principal and accrued interest on my investment will automatically be reinvested for a term as may be decided by ICICI Bank and at such rates as may be applicable at the time of reinvestment.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">Business Term Deposits will have to be opened for a minimum of 5 days to be eligible for any interest payout and single counterparty transaction amount shall not exceed CAD $ 5 million.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">For Term Deposits of one year or longer and in currencies other than United States Dollars, interest is calculated on the basis of 365 or 366 days and compounded and/or paid annually. </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">When ICICI Bank offers Term Deposits in currencies for terms of less than one year, interest is calculated on the basis of 365 or 366 and paid at maturity. For Term Deposits denominated in United States Dollars and over a one year term, interest is calculated on the basis of 360 days and compounded and/or paid annually. When ICICI Bank offers term deposits in United States Dollars for terms of less than one year, interest is calculated on the basis of 360 days and paid at maturity. The principal amount shall not become payable until the maturity date, unless I have chosen to redeem my Term Deposit prior to its maturity date. The rate of interest paid on a Term Deposit that is cashed prior to maturity, when permitted, will be adjusted to equal the cashable interest rate agreed to on the original purchase of the Term Deposit. A Term Deposit is not negotiable and may not be assigned by me.</p>        
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Overdrafts</h6>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">ICICI Bank may, at its discretion, set an Overdraft Limit for an Account and ICICI Bank may change it periodically. Where such an Overdraft Limit is set for an Account, ICICI Bank will tell me what the Overdraft Limit for the Account is on statements for the Account or, in the case of an Account to which a bankbook applies, when I ask ICICI Bank for this information. I will not overdraw an Account beyond its Overdraft Limit. ICICI Bank may refuse to honour a withdrawal request made against an Account or to pay a cheque or other payment order drawn on an Account that is presented to ICICI Bank for payment if there are insufficient available funds (including the Overdraft Limit, if any) in the Account to honour the withdrawal request or to pay the cheque or other payment order. </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">ICICI Bank may refuse to do so even if it has previously honoured withdrawal requests against the Account or previously paid cheques or other payment orders drawn on the Account that have exceeded the Overdraft Limit for the Account or increased the amount by which that Overdraft Limit was exceeded.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">Subject to the foregoing, ICICI Bank may, in its discretion, permit an overdraft in an Account to exceed the Overdraft Limit for the Account from time to time. If for any reason, including actions by ICICI Bank, an Account is overdrawn, it is deemed to be a loan made to me, and I will pay ICICI Bank interest on the amount overdrawn at the then-current interest rate set out in the Disclosure Statement. ICICI Bank will post that interest to the Account on a monthly basis at the time(s) set out in the Disclosure Statement. I will pay all Account Overdrafts, including interest on those overdrafts, to ICICI Bank on demand.</p>

ICICI Bank is unable to guarantee the date on which requests for transfer of funds initiated by me will be completed.

        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">For my security and to designate my Canadian or US Dollar Savings Account - the Designated Link Account - at my Designated Financial Institution (my US Dollar Savings Account linked to my ICICI Bank Personal Savings Account USD must be held with a Canadian financial institution and cheques from that account must clear in Canada) an initial encoded personal cheque must be provided to ICICI Bank for each such Account and cleared through each such external account. By sending my personal cheque to ICICI Bank, I understand that I indicate that it is my express wish to designate the related external account as my Designated Link Account. ICICI Bank may limit the number of external accounts that can be established. I agree, through this initial cheque deposit, that all further business with ICICI Bank may be transacted on my instructions through any medium offered from time to time by ICICI Bank and that all transactions by telephone, computer or other means (whether electronic or otherwise) will have the same legal effect as if authorized by me through written instructions. I understand that I must keep at least one valid Designated Link Account in place at all times when dealing with ICICI Bank solely through Direct Banking. ICICI Bank reserves the right not to open any Account if ICICI Bank’s internal account opening requirements are not met. </p>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">If a Designated Link Account is established, in accordance with internal procedures set by ICICI Bank, in relation to an Account, I understand that by providing an initial encoded personal or business (as applicable) deposit cheque, I authorize ICICI Bank to process funds transfer requests against my Account according to the Rules of the Canadian Payments Association. I acknowledge that my authorization is provided for the benefit of ICICI Bank and the Designated Financial Institution(s) and is provided in consideration of ICICI Bank agreeing to process debits against my Designated Link Account in accordance with this Agreement and the Direct Banking Terms as agreed to with ICICI Bank. Cancelling this authorization does not terminate any other agreement that exists between me and ICICI Bank. My authorization applies only to the method of payment and does not otherwise have any bearing on any agreement for services with ICICI Bank. I authorize and assure ICICI Bank that all individuals who have signed up for Direct Banking services or agreed to ICICI Bank Bank’s Website Terms and Conditions for my Account are all those who are required to sign on my Designated Link Account at my Designated Financial Institution. The Designated Financial Institution is not required to verify that the debits are drawn in accordance with this authorization. I agree to notify ICICI Bank in accordance with Section 37 of this Agreement of any change in the information respecting my Designated Link Account prior to my request to ICICI Bank for any transfer of funds. I may cancel this authorization at any time by providing written notice to ICICI Bank. I agree that my cancellation of this authorization is deemed to take effect upon receipt by ICICI Bank of the required notice.</p>

        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">ICICI Bank may, at its discretion, levy charges for non-maintenance of the minimum balance, if stipulated for any Account. In addition to the minimum balance stipulation, ICICI Bank may levy service charges which ICICI Bank has notified me from time to time. Any change in such service charges will also be notified to me.

ICICI Bank also has the right to refuse to accept a deposit to an Account. I acknowledge that nothing in the Account Documents between ICICI Bank and me will prevent ICICI Bank from either restricting access to an Account or refusing to release funds in an Account if ICICI Bank is required to do so or if, in its opinion, there is unusual or suspicious activity in the Account.</p>
    </li>

Such bank or other party shall be deemed to be my agent and ICICI Bank will not, in any circumstances, be responsible or liable to me by reason of any act or omission of such bank or other party, however caused, in the performance of such service or by reason of the loss, theft, destruction or delayed delivery of any instrument while in transit to or from, or in the possession of, such bank or other party.

        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12px;color: #4a4a4a;">I will ensure that before I negotiate a cheque or other payment order drawn on a financial institution from the United States of America, each instrument will bear my name (as it appears on the instrument) and account number on the back of the instrument. If the required information is not present, the instrument will be returned and ICICI Bank will debit my Account.</p>
